   - All Weather portfolio tilts
   - Economic cycle positioning

3. **📈 PTJ Trend Agent**
   - Multi-timeframe momentum
   - ATR-based position sizing
   - Risk-managed trend following

4. **⚡ Microstructure Agent**
   - Execution optimization

5. **🛡️ Drawdown Guardian**
   - Enhanced risk management
   - Dynamic position sizing
   - Stress-period protection

### 🎯 Decision Gateway - Universal Agent Interface

- **ROI-Focused Filtering**: Trade only if `alpha_bps >= κ × (fees + slippage + borrow)`
- **Signal Ensemble**: Performance-weighted combination of agent signals
- **Regime-Aware Allocation**: Dynamic capital allocation based on market conditions
- **Risk Controls**: Portfolio-level constraints and limits

### 🎓 Agent Onboarding System

- **2-Week Sandbox Evaluation**: New agents start with 1% allocation
- **KPI-Based Promotion**: Automatic promotion/demotion based on performance
- **Performance Tracking**: Edge after cost, Information Coefficient, Sharpe ratio
- **Capacity Scaling**: Risk-adjusted allocation increases for successful agents

### 📊 Multi-Agent Dashboard

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Agent performance and portfolio analytics
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit-based dashboard with 5 comprehensive tabs
- **System Management**: Agent controls and configuration
- **Performance Attribution**: Detailed P&L breakdown by agent

## 🎛️ Key System Features

### ✅ Universal Agent I/O
- Standardized `AgentSignal` format with alpha_bps predictions
- Common interface for all agents regardless of strategy
- Automatic signal validation and normalization

### ✅ ROI-Focused Framework
- **Cost Threshold**: 2x cost coverage minimum (configurable)
- **Cost Buffer**: Safety margin for execution uncertainty
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Real-time ROI validation

### ✅ Regime-Aware Capital Allocation
```python
regime_allocations = {
    LOW_VOL_UPTREND: {"ptj_trend": 0.25, "simons_stat_arb": 0.20, ...},
    HIGH_VOL_DOWNTREND: {"dalio_macro": 0.30, "drawdown_guardian": 0.35, ...},
    SIDEWAYS_CHOP: {"simons_stat_arb": 0.35, "microstructure": 0.25, ...},
    MACRO_TRANSITION: {"dalio_macro": 0.40, "drawdown_guardian": 0.30, ...}
}
```

### ✅ Automatic Agent Management
- **Sandbox → Active → Veteran** progression
- **Performance Thresholds**: 70% to pass sandbox, 85% for veteran status
- **Allocation Scaling**: 1% → 2-15% → up to 25% based on performance
