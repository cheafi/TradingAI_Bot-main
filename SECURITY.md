## Security Best Practices 🛡️

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: 
   - Use strong API keys and tokens
   - Limit API permissions to minimum required
   - Use environment variables for secrets
3. **Network Security**: 
   - Use HTTPS for all connections
   - Consider VPN for sensitive operations
4. **Access Control**: 
   - Limit Telegram bot access
   - Use unique credentials per environment

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: 
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `pip-audit` or similar tools
   - Pin dependency versions in production

2. **API Keys & Secrets**:
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables or secret management
   - Rotate keys regularly

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries

4. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Validate permissions for each operation

### Security Configurations

#### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required security configurations
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_secure_token_here
API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Optional security enhancements
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING  # Avoid logging sensitive data
```

#### Docker Security

```dockerfile
# Use non-root user
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser
USER appuser

# Use specific versions
FROM python:3.11-slim-bullseye

# Limit capabilities
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

## Common Security Risks ⚠️

### 1. API Key Exposure
- **Risk**: Hardcoded API keys in source code
- **Mitigation**: Use environment variables and .env files
- **Detection**: Regular code scans for secrets

### 2. Telegram Bot Security
- **Risk**: Unauthorized bot access
- **Mitigation**: Implement user authentication and rate limiting
- **Detection**: Monitor unusual bot activity

### 3. Trading API Misuse
- **Risk**: Excessive trading permissions
- **Mitigation**: Use read-only keys when possible, implement position limits
- **Detection**: Monitor trading activity and set alerts

### 4. Data Exposure
- **Risk**: Sensitive trading data in logs or error messages
- **Mitigation**: Sanitize logs, use structured logging
- **Detection**: Regular log audits

### 5. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Vulnerable third-party packages
- **Mitigation**: Regular dependency updates, vulnerability scanning
- **Detection**: Automated dependency checks in CI/CD

## Security Tools & Integrations 🔧

### Automated Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions security checks
- name: Security scan with bandit
  run: bandit -r src/ -f json -o security-report.json

- name: Dependency vulnerability check
  run: pip-audit --requirement requirements.txt

- name: Secret scanning
  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
```

### Recommended Tools

1. **Static Analysis**: `bandit`, `semgrep`
